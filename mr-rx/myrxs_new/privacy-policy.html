                            </button> 
                            <div class="panel"> 
                              <p>RealTime Clinic complies with the seven Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, which require the following:</p>

                              <p>1. Notice Organizations must notify individuals about the purposes for which they collect and use information about them. They must provide information about how individuals can contact the organization with any inquiries or complaints, the types of third parties to which they disclose the information and the choices and means the organization offers for limiting its use and disclosure.</p>

                              <p>2. Choice Organizations must give individuals the opportunity to choose (opt out) whether their personal information will be disclosed to a third party or
used for a purpose incompatible with the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. For sensitive information, affirmative or explicit (opt in) choice must be given if the information is to be disclosed to a third party or used for a purpose other than its original purpose or the purpose authorized subsequently by the individual.</p>

                              <p>3. Onward Transfer (Transfers to Third Parties) – To disclose information to a third party, organizations must apply the notice and choice principles. Where an organization wishes to transfer information to a third party that is acting as an agent, it may do so if it makes sure that the third party subscribes to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles or is subject to the Directive or another adequacy finding. As an alternative, the organization can enter into a written agreement with such third party requiring that the third party provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the relevant principles.</p>

                              <p>4. Access – Individuals must have access to personal information about themselves that an organization holds and be able to correct, amend, or delete that information where it is inaccurate, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.</p>

                              <p>5. Security Organizations must take reasonable precautions to protect personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.
                              </p>

                              <p>6. Data integrity Personal information must be relevant for the purposes for which it is to be used. An organization should take reasonable steps to ensure that data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.</p>

                              <p>7. Enforcement – In order to ensure compliance with the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, there must be (a) readily available and affordable independent recourse mechanisms so that each individual’s complaints and disputes can be investigated and resolved and damages awarded where the applicable law or private sector initiatives so provide; (b) procedures for verifying that the commitments companies make to adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy</p>

                              <p>Principles have been implemented; and (c) obligations to remedy problems arising out of a failure to comply with the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles. Sanctions must be sufficiently rigorous to ensure compliance by the organization. Organizations that fail to provide annual self-certification letters reaffirming their commitment to the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and/or the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework will no longer be assured of the relevant Safe Harbor benefits and may ultimately be removed from the list of participants maintained on the Safe Harbor website.</p>

                              <p><strong>NOTICES AND PROCEDURE FOR MAKING CLAIMS OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT:</strong></p>

                              <p>RealTime Clinic respects the intellectual property of others, and we ask our customers to do the same.

If you are under 18 and are not supervised by an adult, please do not use this site. Parents are urged to monitor and supervise their children’s on-line activity.

                              <p>RealTime Clinic will not knowingly collect personal data from children without insisting that they seek prior parental consent if required by applicable law. We will only use or disclose personal data about a child to the extent permitted by law, to seek parental consent pursuant to local law and regulations or to protect a child. The definition of “child” or “children” should take into account applicable laws as well as national and regional cultural customs.</p>

                              <p>The Site is a general audience site that is not designed or intended to collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. RealTime Clinic does not knowingly collect Personal Information through the Site from anyone under the age of 13. To respect the privacy of children and to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, children under the age of 13 should not provide any Personal Information on this Site. We ask that parents supervise their children while online.</p>

                              <p>The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, effective April 21, 2000, applies to the online collection of personal information from children under 13. The new rules
spell out what a Web site operator must include in a privacy policy, when and how to seek verifiable consent from a parent and what responsibilities an operator has to protect children’s privacy and safety online.</p>

                              <p>The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and Rule apply to individually identifiable information about a child that is collected online, such as full name, home address, email address, telephone number or any other information that would allow someone to identify or contact the child. The Act and Rule also cover other types of information — for example, hobbies, interests and information collected through cookies or other types of tracking mechanisms — when they are tied to individually identifiable information.</p>

                              <p>Verifiable Parental Consent …Before collecting, using or disclosing personal information from a child, an operator must obtain verifiable parental consent from the child’s parent. This means an operator must make reasonable efforts (taking into consideration available technology) to ensure that before personal information is collected from a child, a parent of the child receives notice of the operator’s information practices and consents to those practices.</p>
